# An attempt at the 2019 ISIC Challenge
This repo holds code, daframes and trained models for my attempt at the 2019 ISIC Challenge.

There is also a branch for an assignment related to Universidade de Brasília's (University of Brasília) course Fundamentos de Sistemas Inteligentes (Fundaments on Inteligent Systems), named `fund_sist_inteligentes`, containing code and an article for said assignment.

Most of the documentation should be in english and, if it is not, it'll be translated at some point. The exception is, of course, the branch `fund_sist_inteligentes`, which documents the assingment for said course and should be in both english and brazilian portuguese, but I won't translate any content there to english.

## Projeto de pesquisa - Fundamentos de Sistemas Inteligentes
O código, documentação e artigo estão na *branch* [`fund_sist_inteligentes`](https://github.com/PeterTowers/skinLesion/tree/fund_sist_inteligentes). O conteúdo da branch `main` pode não estar relacionado com a tarefa da disciplina.

The code, documentation and article are on `fund_sist_inteligentes` branch. `main`'s content may not be related with the course's assignment.

## TODO
1. Better document this repo's readme.
